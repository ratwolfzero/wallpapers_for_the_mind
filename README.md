# Wallpaper Pattern Generator, ***Wallpaper for the mind***

![Circle](circle_1.png)

## Historical Context

This Python script generates visually stunning wallpaper patterns based on a mathematical algorithm developed by John E. Connett. The algorithm was introduced in A.K. Dewdney's "Computer Recreations" column in Scientific American (September 1986), where he coined the name Circle² for this method. It explores the mathematical properties of grid-based coordinate systems and the equation:

$$
\large
z = x² + y²
\large
$$

The Circle² algorithm visualizes the distribution of squared sums \( z = x² + y² \) for a structured grid of coordinates \((x, y)\).  
By assigning colors based on the properties of \( z \), the algorithm creates concentric circular patterns.

## How It Works

This algorithm computes a grid-based wallpaper pattern by evaluating the function:

$$
z = x² + y²
$$

for each grid point \((x, y)\), where \( x \) and \( y \) are derived from a scaled coordinate system. The integer part of \( z \) (or its direct modulo operation) is used to assign colors cyclically from a predefined palette.

### **Approach**

1. **Grid Construction:**
   - The grid spans a defined rectangular area, with \( x \) and \( y \) values computed based on a scaling factor.
   - In the historical loop-based version, this is done iteratively for each pixel.
   - In the optimized NumPy version, this is achieved efficiently using vectorized operations.

2. **Squared Sum Computation:**
   - Each coordinate pair is mapped to \( z = x² + y² \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are **not necessarily integers** but follow a structured grid pattern.

3. **Color Assignment:**
   - The integer-based modulo operation \((z \mod \text{NUM_COLORS})\) cycles through a fixed color palette.
   - The historical version explicitly converts \( z \) to an integer before applying modulo, while the optimized version lets NumPy handle it directly.

## Customization

Adjust the following parameters to create unique designs:

- **WIDTH, HEIGHT**: Resolution of the image.
- **CORNER_A, CORNER_B**: Lower-left corner of the grid.
- **SIDE**: Side length of the grid.
- **NUM_COLORS**: Number of colors in the palette.

## Example

Varying the `NUM_COLORS` parameter will dramatically change the look of the pattern. Experiment with different values to see how the design evolves!

## Efficiency Considerations

- The **historical implementation** uses explicit loops and per-element calculations, making it conceptually clear but is computationally more expensive.
- The **NumPy-optimized version** avoids explicit iteration

## Further Exploration

- Try different mathematical functions to create new patterns.
- Implement custom color palettes.
- Explore other pattern-generation algorithms in computer graphics and recreational mathematics.
